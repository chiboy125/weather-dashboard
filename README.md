# Weather Dashboard 🌦️

The **Weather Dashboard** is a React-based web application that allows users to search for and view current weather conditions and forecasts for any city. It demonstrates frontend skills in **React, API integration, and responsive UI design**.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🌍 **City Search** – Type a city name to fetch real-time weather data.  
- 🌡️ **Current Conditions** – Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.  
- 📅 **Forecast** – Shows a 5-day weather outlook with icons and details.  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.  

---

## 🔎 How It Works
1. User enters a city name into the search bar.  
2. The app calls a **Weather API** (like OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve weather data.  
3. Weather results are displayed in two sections:  
   - **Current Weather Card** – Shows present weather conditions.  
   - **Forecast Cards** – Displays weather predictions for the upcoming days.  
4. Data updates automatically whenever a new city is searched.
